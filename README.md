# Phonebook Backend

This repository is the code for the part 3 exercises of [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3).

## Running

As per the exercise instruction, script `npm start` and `npm run dev`
are offered as an entry point to the service.

`npm start` simply runs the backend.

`npm run dev` runs the backend and restarts it on seeing changes to
the source code.
